# Linear Regression in Machine learning

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and 
one or more independent variables. It provides valuable insights for prediction and data analysis.

Understanding Linear Regression
Linear regression is also a type of supervised machine-learning algorithm that learns from the labelled datasets and maps the data points with most optimized linear functions which can be used for prediction on new datasets. It computes the linear relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent features by fitting a linear equation with observed data. It predicts the continuous output variables based on the independent input variable.

For example if we want to predict house price we consider various factor such as  distance from the main road, location,
area and number of room, linear regression uses all these parameter to predict house price 
as it consider a linear relation between all these features and price of house.

Linear Equations: y = mx + c
where, 
y = Dependent Variable
m = Slope/gradient/Coefficient
x = Independent Variable
c = Intercept
